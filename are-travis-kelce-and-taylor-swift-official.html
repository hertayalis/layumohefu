For Swifties, the Pennsylvania native’s love life is a very important topic of interest and a predictor of what to expect next music-wise. If she is in a happy relationship, we’ll likely get some new love songs. And if things go wrong, we’ll likely get some breakup songs.</p><p>After ending a six-year relationship with actor <a href=#>Joe Alywn</a> in early 2023, then seemingly jumping into a dalliance with the 1975 lead singer <a href=#>Matty Healy</a>, Taylor has been spending the last few months of 2023 hanging out with <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a> tight end <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a>, who openly admitted in July on his podcast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New Heights</a> that he went to see Taylor in concert and tried to give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it but wasn't able to.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty images</span><p>Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift in New York City in October 2023</p></figure><p>It's safe to say that there are millions of men vying for Taylor's heart who would do the same. However, most of them probably didn't win the <a href=#>Super Bowl</a> earlier that year, so Travis definitely had a leg up.</p><p>On Sept. 24, 2023, she accepted his invitation to watch his team play against the Chicago Bears at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City. She sat next to his mom Donna Kelce and afterwards, they went on a date. The <a href=#>internet reacted with a total memefest</a>.</p><p>In the weeks since, they’ve continued to hang out more frequently without putting a label on it. That said, many people just want to know: Are Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift official?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift officially dating?</h2><p>Yes, it is believed Taylor and Travis are officially dating. While Taylor isn't the type of person who posts her boyfriends up on the gram and usually keeps her relationships private, she left a few breadcrumbs behind that seemingly confirm that she and Travis are a couple.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Taylor Swift Edits (@tswiftedits_13)</a></p></figure><p>During a Nov. 12, 2023 concert in Argentina as part of Eras's tour, Taylor changed the lyrics of "Karma" to “Karma is the guy from the Chiefs coming home to me," referring to Travis. In the chorus, she repeatedly sings "Karma is my boyfriend." She was making it very clear to her millions of fans and Travis who was in attendance, that he is indeed her boyfriend.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>TAYLOR AND TRAVIS ARE OFFICIAL 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻</p>— molly wright (@mollywrightxxx) <a href=#>November 12, 2023</a></figure><p>The "Lavender Haze" further officiated their relationship later that same night by running backstage to Travis after the show ended and giving him a kiss, which fan account <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift Edits</a> on Instagram captured. Taylor knows there's always a chance that fans are recording her, even as she exits the stage. That said, and if she wanted to keep her romance hush-hush with Travis, she probably would have at least waited until they were in the tent to lay it on him hot and heavy.</p><p>Now, the next order of business is deciding on a cute couple's name for their pair. Fans have been referring to them as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Traylor, Tayvis, and Swelce</a>, but can't seem to decide on which one suits the couple best.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>lets settle this<br>what is the official ship name for taylor and travis</p>— 𝖑 𝖎 𝖛 დ. 51 days!

In case you missed it, WAG (or Wags) is an acronym used to refer to wives and girlfriends of high-profile athletes. And now that Taylor is officially dating Travis, she qualifies as a WAG. If you look at Taylor's past relationships, this is the first time she has ever dated an athlete. She usually opts for relationships with musicians and actors.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Travis Kelce get a tattoo of Taylor Swift?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Imagine if Travis Kelce got this Taylor Swift tattoo 🤣☠️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XfB2r2EvKn</a></p>— Whistle (@WhistleSports) <a href=#>September 27, 2023</a></figure><p>No, Travis Kelce did not get a tattoo of Taylor Swift. While Travis and Taylor are very much a couple, they've yet to start inking their bodies up in the name of love.</p><p>Fans started to believe Travis got a tattoo of Taylor after an image started circulating around the internet of him showing off his bicep, which appeared to have an illustration of Taylor's face inked on. This photo of Travis was created with artificial intelligence. While the NFL player does have an impressive collection of tattoos, he has yet to get any Taylor-inspired ink just yet.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=#>Taylor does not have any tattoos</a>.
