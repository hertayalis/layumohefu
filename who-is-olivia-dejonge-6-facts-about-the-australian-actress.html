She always liked to play</span></strong></h4><p><span>As stated, DeJonge has always enjoyed performing since she was a child.&nbsp;Between the ages of 8 and 14, the Australian actress had already produced up to 41 radio and TV voiceovers as well as 4 TV spots.&nbsp;When she was 12, she was signed to talent manager and actress Theresa Huska.&nbsp;While Huska represents her at the Independent Management Company in Australia, she is represented by the Creative Artists Agency in Hollywood.</span></p><h4><strong><span>2. There have been many rejections for her along the way</span></strong></h4><p><span>Because Olivia has had the best side of the Australian film industry and has now sold herself to Hollywood, you’d think she’s had it all rosy.&nbsp;Contrary to that, it was not easy for her.&nbsp;In four years, she’s done over 70 auditions and had so many rejections in the process that she now doesn’t feel too bad about being turned down.&nbsp;When she was younger, she said every rejection would upset her, but now she’s all grown up.</span></p><h4><strong><span>3. She didn’t finish her studies</span></strong></h4><p><span>Due to her acting career, she has not had the full opportunity to focus solely on her education.&nbsp;Nevertheless, Dejonge is not ready to give up on education.&nbsp;She plans to study psychology.</span></p><p><span>Playing will always be the first thing for her but she doesn’t want to keep it as her only goal, which is why she is interested in going back to school.&nbsp;The young Aussie hopes to study at the University of Melbourne.</span></p><h4><strong><span>4. DeJonge is a feminist</span></strong></h4><p><span>In&nbsp;</span><span>Willpower</span><span>&nbsp;which is a television drama series based fictionally on the life of William Shakespeare, she plays Alice Burbage, a “feminist” who decides that instead of getting married, she will pursue her dreams without fear.&nbsp;Beyond the character, Olivia is also a feminist who says she doesn’t want to relegate herself to the role of girlfriend.</span></p><h4><strong><span>5. Professional Achievements</span></strong></h4><p><span>With less than 10 movies and TV productions to her name, Olivia DeJonge has accomplished a lot and she has been recognized in the form of awards.</span></p><p><span>She won the West Australian Screen Awards for Best Actress for her role in Good Pretenders and garnered numerous nominations including Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA) awards and the Logie Awards.</span></p><h4><strong><span>6. She still lives in Perth, Western Australia</span></strong></h4><p><span>Olivia has come a long way since she started acting.&nbsp;Inasmuch as she now gigs in Hollywood, she still resides in Perth, Western Australia with her parents and younger brother, James.</span></p><p><span>As of 2018, his net worth was placed at less than $1 million.&nbsp;That said, his fortune should soon increase with his involvement in more things.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMqKOirpmWeqWxyailoJ1da3qnrcKtqmaZkqTCtXnToZxmmaWowbOty6KYp2WRmMGzsdKsZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-olivia-dejonge-6-facts-about-the-australian-actress.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-olivia-dejonge-6-facts-about-the-australian-actress.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-olivia-dejonge-6-facts-about-the-australian-actress.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-olivia-dejonge-6-facts-about-the-australian-actress.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-olivia-dejonge-6-facts-about-the-australian-actress.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-olivia-dejonge-6-facts-about-the-australian-actress.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./all-to-know-about-jonas-brothers-career-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./all-to-know-about-jonas-brothers-career-net-worth.html>All To Know about Jonas Brothers; Career, Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./alex-aiono-girlfriend.html>Is the 'Finding 'Ohana' Star Single?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./alex-aiono-girlfriend.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
