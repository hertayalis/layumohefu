Under Motley’s guidance, Australian Football Hall of Fame legend Barrie Robran debuted and won the first Magarey Medal.</p><p>Following his retirement, Geof Motley received a number of honors including Life Member of Port Adelaide and SANFL, as well as Member of the South Australian Football Hall of Fame and Australian Football Hall of Fame.
