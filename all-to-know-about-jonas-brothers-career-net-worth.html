The following year, Nick started to perform on Broadway, in plays such as A Christmas Carol and Annie Get Your Gun.</p><p>In 2002, Nick wrote a song with his dad, entitled ‘Joy To The World (A Christmas Prayer)’. The song was included on the Broadway’s Greatest Gifts: Carols For A Cure benefit compilation of that year. The song became popular on Christian radio.</p><p>Jo Jonas followed his brother into Broadway, appearing in a version of La Boheme, directed by Baz Luhrmann.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In 2004, Nick signed a deal with Columbia Records and a solo album, Nicholas Jonas, was released.

They also took part in an anti-drugs tour with The Cheetah Girls.</p><p>The debut album, It’s About Time, was released in 2006 and featured songwriting from Adam Schlesinger (Fountains of Wayne) and the songwriters responsible for hits by Destiny’s Child and Aerosmith, amongst others. On the album, Jonas Brothers also covered two songs by the English boy band Busted: ‘What I Go To School For’ and ‘Year 3000’.</p><p>In 2007, the band was dropped by Columbia Records.</p><p>The same year, they signed a deal with Hollywood Records and also appeared at the W hite House in Washington, singing the National Anthem at Easter.</p><p>The band’s second album titled Jonas Brothers, was released in August 2007 and it spawned two hit singles, ‘Hold On’ and ‘S.O.S’. In August of that year, the band appeared in an episode of Hannah Montana, performing ‘We Got the Party’ with Miley Cyrus.</p><p>A Little Bit Longer was the title given to the band’s third studio album, which featured tracks such as ‘Burnin’ Up’ and ‘Pushin’ Me Away’.

Their father is a pastor and the boys were taught at home by their mother rather than attending a regular school. At the MTV Video Music Awards, Russell Brand mocked the boys’ decision to wear purity rings. The rings are a symbol of their commitment to abstaining from sex before marriage.</p><p>The band earned a reported $12 million during 2007 and they donate 10% of their earnings to a charitable foundation that they have set up. The organisation is named the ‘Change For the Children Foundation’.</p><p>Nick Jonas was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 13 and is the ambassador for the Bayer Diabetes Care organization.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jonas Brothers Net Worth</h2><p>The three Jonas Brothers,&nbsp;Kevin,&nbsp;Joe&nbsp;and Nick, are a wildly successful American Pop Rock Boy Band who have a combined net worth of&nbsp;$150 million.</p><p>Each brother has an estimated net worth of one-third of that money — $50 million.
