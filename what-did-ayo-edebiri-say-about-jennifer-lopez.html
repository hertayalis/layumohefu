Ayo's old comments were pretty harsh.</p>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jhDJkI eZknfg">Joseph Allen</a><p class="sc-ensa-Dq fPmIpI">Feb. 14 2024, Published 11:09 a.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>Because the internet is a terrible place, <a href=#>Ayo Edebiri</a> is now dealing with the fallout from some harsh comments she made about <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a> years ago on her podcast. The clip was dug up because Ayo was hosting Saturday Night Live, and JLo was the musical guest.</p><p>JLo has decided to be gracious about the whole thing, but some people are still wondering exactly what Ayo said, and whether it's as bad as everyone seems to think. Here's what we know about what Ayo said, and about how JLo has decided to respond.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What did Ayo Edebiri say about Jennifer Lopez?</h2><p>In a 2020 podcast clip, Ayo discussed JLo just before her Super Bowl halftime show, saying that her career was one long "scam" and questioning how well she could actually sing.</p><p>"Well, that's the thing. She thinks she's on multiple tracks, but it's not her," Ayo said. "I think she thinks that she's still good even though, like, she's not singing for most of these songs."</p><p>"A lot of the write-ups of the songs will be like, 'J.Lo didn't have time to make it to the studio,' like, J.Lo was busy," Ayo continued. "It's like, 'Doing what?' Not singing, obviously."</p><p>There was also a reference to Ayo's comments during one of the evening's sketches in which Ayo played a character who had said mean things online, and was eventually forced to apologize for them.</p><p>"OK, OK! We get it. It's wrong to leave mean comments or post comments just for clout or run your mouth on a podcast, and you don't consider the impact because you're 24 and stupid," Ayo said. "But I think I speak for everyone when I say, from now on, we're going to be a lot more thoughtful about what we post online."</p><p>Ayo also apparently apologized to JLo privately for the comments.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jennifer Lopez is ready to forgive and forget.</h2><p>Although the comments weren't great, JLo gave an interview with Variety in which she said she was ready to move on from the whole affair.</p><p>“She was mortified and very sweet,” JLo said, explaining that Ayo had come to her dressing room at SNL to apologize.</p><p>“She came to my dressing room and apologized with tears in her eyes, saying how terrible it was that she had said those things. She felt really badly and loved my performance because we had just done my soundcheck and she actually got to hear me perform," JLo continued.</p><p>“She was just like, ‘I’m so f--king sorry, it was so awful of me,’ the singer added.</p><p>JLo also said that she had shrugged the comments off, adding that this wasn't the first time someone had doubted her in her career.</p><p>“It’s funny. I’ve heard similar things said about me throughout my career, so it really didn’t affect me," JLo explained.</p><p>Thankfully, it seems like it's all water under the bridge. Ayo likely didn't expect to ever meet JLo when she said that stuff, and now she knows to be a little bit more careful with her words.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydoJ1lka68brHDnpmiqpliwKLFjJqZqK2kYremus2inZ6qXaG8sbHZ</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-did-ayo-edebiri-say-about-jennifer-lopez.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-did-ayo-edebiri-say-about-jennifer-lopez.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-did-ayo-edebiri-say-about-jennifer-lopez.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-did-ayo-edebiri-say-about-jennifer-lopez.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-did-ayo-edebiri-say-about-jennifer-lopez.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-did-ayo-edebiri-say-about-jennifer-lopez.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./john-amos-age-net-worth-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./john-amos-age-net-worth-html.html>At 80, John Amos Is Proving That Age Is Just a Number a Brief Look at His Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-doobie-brothers-takin-it-to-the-streets-lyrics.html>The Doobie Brothers Takin It To The Streets Lyrics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-doobie-brothers-takin-it-to-the-streets-lyrics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
