Brandon was doing his job, unloading a package from his truck, when a man in a car almost hit him, got out, spat in his face, and called him the n-word.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Immediately after the incident, Brandon took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Live</a> and cried while sitting in his delivery truck. In a 6-minute long video that has now gone viral, Brandon explains exactly what happens. The pain and tears in his eyes show just how raw the moment was.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"So, what the f--k is the point of all of this protest s--t if it don't work?" Brandon asks. "I'm in the country right now and I'm delivering, and I'm sitting at a f--king stop, and I'm waiting to get out.&nbsp;</p><p>"There's a lot of cars waiting, and as I'm getting the package out of the back of the truck, some f--king hick speeds around me, damn near hit me, called me [the n-word], and spit on me."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He continues, "Why? Why so much hate? Why so much hate? Why? Why? ... Almost hit me, called me [the n-word], and then spit on me. Spit on me?! Really?! Wow. Just wow. Wow."</p><p>Brandon's emotion is palpable throughout the video. He stopped delivering packages because he was so overcome with emotion. "I can't even think straight right now," he says. "This s--t is horrible. I think it's a lot worse than a lot of people think. It's a lot worse.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>"Racism is live. And if any of you ever had to go through that s--t firsthand, and if any of you ever had to f--king experience racism firsthand, I promise you ... This world is so f--ked up, so f--ked up."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When you think about incidents like this, which are just the tip of the iceberg that is racism in the United States, it's no wonder Black people have higher rates of stress and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">high blood pressure</a>, which leads to heart disease and death. Overt racism like what Brandon experienced and more subtle racism, which is rampant in our institutions and systems, are all responsible for harrowing statistics like that one.</p><p>"That's the worst part," Brandon continues in his video, "is that I've known how terrible this s--t has been... I've been f--king seeing this s--t since day one."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Brandon told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a> that this incident occurred around 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday, June 10 in Lisbon, Ohio. He described the man who called him a slur and spat on him as an "older white male," around 50-65 years old, who was bald and wearing glasses and had "scruffy facial hair." The man was driving a 2007-2009 Ford Escape.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>A spokesperson for FedEx released a statement about the incident: "We are both saddened and outraged. This type of behavior has no place in society, and our first concern is for our team member. We are staying connected offering our support. At FedEx, our workforce is as diverse as the world we serve, and we believe that everyone deserves respect."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Fox8</a>, Lisbon's Mayor Peter Wilson has confirmed that a police report has been filed and an investigation is happening. Hopefully, this man will be brought to justice.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7Klsddmm6uhppq%2Fbr%2FPmqtmp55iv6KvyKyrZq6Zp66tedWim56n</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffedex-driver-spat-on-racist-viral-video.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffedex-driver-spat-on-racist-viral-video.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffedex-driver-spat-on-racist-viral-video.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffedex-driver-spat-on-racist-viral-video.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffedex-driver-spat-on-racist-viral-video.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffedex-driver-spat-on-racist-viral-video.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jimi-hendrixs-sister-janie-hendrix-mysterious-death-suspects.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jimi-hendrixs-sister-janie-hendrix-mysterious-death-suspects.html>Jimi Hendrixs sister Janie Hendrix on his mysterious death: The suspects are gone</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./yamaha-kodiak-400-4x4.html>Yamaha Kodiak 400 44 Price, Specs and Review 2022</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./yamaha-kodiak-400-4x4.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
