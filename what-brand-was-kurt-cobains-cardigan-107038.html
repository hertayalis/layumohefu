According to fashion historian Kimberly Chrisman-Campbell, the acrylic, mohair and Lycra blend cardigan was likely made between 1960 and ’65, when silky mohair was a popular material for menswear.</p><p>Darren Julien, president of Julien’s Auction, called Cobain’s mohair cardigan “the holy grail of any article of clothing that he ever wore”. Cobain’s custom-made Fender Mustang guitar – which he used during Nirvana’s In Utero tour – was also on sale, and fetched $340,000 (£265,000).</p><p>The “Unplugged” concert is considered one of the band’s best performances, and it made the thrift-store cardigan iconic. The cardigan has never been washed since the concert and has all the original stains, too, so the new owner is sure to smell a lot like teen spirit.

It has not been cleaned since he last wore it. The iconic piece of clothing is now reportedly the most expensive sweater ever …</p><p>The artist achieved colossal success after forming Nirvana in 1987, but struggled with fame, depression and drug addiction. He killed himself in<strong> April 1994</strong> aged 27. 2.43.6.3bda600.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><h2>How much did the last time the Kurt Cobain cardigan sold?</h2><p>Still, the last time it sold, it fetched a whopping<strong> $137,500.</strong> The cardigan’s not studded with diamonds or knit by a couture atelier. But more than 25 years ago, it was wrapped around Kurt Cobain during Nirvana ’s MTV Unplugged performance. The story of where it came from and what happened to it is more than a half-century long.</p><p>Cobain was a frequent thrift shopper and likely purchased the sweater at<strong> a second-hand shop </strong>, according to Chrisman-Campbell. “It was part of a much larger trend in Seattle in the early Nineties, where people were buying vintage, recycling clothes, and creating clothes from found objects,” she says.</p><p>Kletjian confirms that he’s kept the sweater in mint-grunge condition; he put it on only once, but took it off after less than 40 seconds. “It’s kind of a weird, powerful thing when you do something like that, when we put on somebody else’s [clothes],” he said.</p><p>The long journey of the<strong> $137,500</strong> sweater worn by Nirvana’s frontman. Former race car driver Garrett Kletjian is the self-described “custodian” of the garment. But the cardigan’s journey started 60 years ago. The world’s most expensive cardigan is locked in a gun safe in rural Pennsylvania.</p><p>When the Louvre asked to display the cardigan, Kletjian declined; he felt he<strong> needed to personally make sure it was safe, and Paris was too far away.</strong> Which means the knit is locked in his home, where no one else can appreciate it. “That’s what started to bother me,” he says. “I have this sweater.</p><p>Cobain’s sweater came into being just<strong> before the Nirvana frontman’s own 1967 birth.</strong> According to fashion historian Kimberly Chrisman-Campbell, the acrylic, mohair and Lycra blend cardigan was likely made between 1960 and ’65, when silky mohair was a popular material for menswear.</p><p>The world’s most expensive cardigan is locked in a gun safe in<strong> rural Pennsylvania.</strong> It has a mysterious stain in one of its pockets — “some kind of brown, crunchy something in there,” according to the sweater’s owner, which he guesses could be chocolate, or vomit.
