Currently, at the age of 81, Amos is still active in the industry, surpassing all the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rumors</a> of him being dead.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Amos&nbsp;Brought Afro-American Voice To The Platform&nbsp;</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Amos appeared in various small shows and commercials before getting his big break from the series Good Times. As James Evans, Sr., his role was a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spinoff</a> from the show&nbsp;Maude (1972) to&nbsp;Good Times&nbsp;(1974), which Amos plays spectacularly.</p><p>Being an African-American himself, he gave his input to make the show better. However, this was not received well by the writers of the show. Amos was a&nbsp;strong advocate against the stereotype portrayed for the African-American community. So the&nbsp;Good Times star bashed the writers constantly, which eventually led to his dismissal from the show in 1976. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p></p><p><strong>John in his role as James Evans, Sr in Good Times with his co-star&nbsp;Esther Rolle</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Good Times</a>&nbsp;| Hollywood Outbreak)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, this did not set him back in his career.
