Since that went down about a month ago, Osiris issued an apology and Suki <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">accepted it</a>, even though online debate still ensued. Moreover, fans seem to be split between rightfully calling out this dangerous behavior regardless of context and pointing out her sexually laced content and antics as an excuse. Regardless of what the Twitter threads say, the voice that matters most in this is how the "Love & Hip Hop" star feels. During a recent interview with Armon Wiggins, she reflected on the incident and suggested that she's moved on. "He came over there, and we're filming, mind you, so this is a big opportunity for me," she remarked. "I don't want to look problematic in this male-dominated industry, or television show.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"You know, I'm having a good time, keeping a smile on my face," Sukihana continued. "He had reached in for a kiss, and it was like he don't really know who I am. I feel like he didn't read the room as good, and that's okay. People make mistakes. It was a little bit uncomfortable. You know, me, personally, everybody is different from me. I have my own heart, and I was like 'Oh, my gosh, this is a lot,' you know? But it was a little bit uncomfortable, but it was a playful setting. And I didn't want to embarrass him or embarrass myself or embarrass nobody at the table while we were filming, so I kept it professional at that time. People don't know that I sat there for a minute and I actually had to get up and leave.</p><span></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I don't know the feelings that I felt, I can't explain them," Sukihana went on. "I left set and I didn't continue filming, I went to my room. You know, I was crying a little bit, but I understand why I was crying. It's because I didn't say that I wanted him to do that, because I felt like I was a little bit embarrassed. I was in my room with my team, and I was like, 'I can't go back out there.' Production asked me if I was okay, what they need to do or anything. YK Osiris and his people came to my room, I didn't want to talk, but he was coming to apologize, and that happened days before it got released. Personally, I wanted to just sweep it under the rug. When it came out, it was cr*zy, they were coming for me a lot.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I hadn't even said anything about it," she concluded. "Before he even apologized- he apologized to me <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">multiple times</a>- I already forgave him. Me, with the heart I have, I always say, 'If God can forgive me, I can forgive others.' I'm not saying that all sexual assault victims have to have the same heart as me. You don't have to forgive if you don't want to, but I'm a woman of God. And if God has mercy on me, and he forgives, I can forgive him. I can see the playfulness in him and I can see the human in him. And I know he genuinely didn't mean anything by it. He was having fun, and maybe he was shooting his shot a little bit. But at the end of the day, I'm not upset with him."

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmboJzhJFmqq6jmZ2ur62MsqJmp6Oev6q%2FjKKlrZ2iq7amww%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f695282-sukihana-yk-osiris-interview.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f695282-sukihana-yk-osiris-interview.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f695282-sukihana-yk-osiris-interview.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f695282-sukihana-yk-osiris-interview.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f695282-sukihana-yk-osiris-interview.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f695282-sukihana-yk-osiris-interview.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./top-7-most-deranged-serial-killers-in-the-history-of-california.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./top-7-most-deranged-serial-killers-in-the-history-of-california.html>Top 7 Most Deranged Serial Killers In The History Of California</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kieran-culkin-height-how-tall-is-successions-roman-roy-actor.html>Kieran Culkin Height: How Tall Is Succession's Roman Roy Actor? - SarkariResult</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kieran-culkin-height-how-tall-is-successions-roman-roy-actor.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
