(The outlet reports that <a href=#>J Balvin</a> was actually the first recording artist to move on from Scooter, having kicked off this wave of big-name talent finding new representation in May 2023.)</p><p>However, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a> reported on Aug. 23 that Scooter and Ariana still have a business relationship: "Contract negotiations have been going on for several months" between the two, a source told the outlet, as Scooter is becoming less focused on managing and more focused on "his larger role as Hybe America's CEO." (Scooter joined South Korean entertainment group Hybe in 2021.)</p><p style=text-align:left>"Scooter's team at SB Projects are still handling both Justin and Ariana as they work through what this new structure looks like," the source continued.</p><p style=text-align:left>Another source said Ariana had recently signed a five-year contract with Hybe.</p><p>At time of writing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nothing official</a> has come out as to why so many music industry powerhouses are rumored to be parting ways with Scooter, but that hasn't stopped social media users from speculating about what could be prompting the likes of Demi — and maybe even Ariana and Justin — to look for new management.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Social media has already decided where it stands with Scooter Braun.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>this clip of taylor swift from 2019 mysteriously “resurfaced” yesterday</p><p>today demi lovato and ariana grande dropped scooter braun</p><p>looks like scooter braun is about to be hit with some big allegations. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/q7G2jSAaLc</a></p>— mary morgan (@maryarchived) <a href=#>August 22, 2023</a></figure><p>With other big clients left to lose, such as Ava Max, <a href=#>Dan + Shay</a>, <a href=#>Kelly Rowland</a>, Idina Menzel, and Tori Kelly, it stands to reason that Scooter would want to stop bleeding big names.

In one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">incident</a>, Ariana shared that he forced her to put a track on her album that she felt was too painful. She worked on the track with <a href=#>Mac Miller</a>, her boyfriend who later passed away.</p><p>The overall mood on Twitter is that people are happy to see Scooter get the "Karma" he deserves after <a href=#>what he did to Taylor</a>, and how his reputation has never been the same.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>we’re really witnessing scooter braun’s downfall i used to pray for times like this<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/fhSPJUPPd8</a></p>— katie (@vetaynarian) <a href=#>August 21, 2023</a></figure><p>While we don't know what's behind everyone supposedly leaving Scooter (he also shockingly previously lost <a href=#>The Kid Laroi</a> as a client), what a source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a> in 2022 may hint at what is yet to be revealed. Scooter has reportedly done anything imaginable to retain his clout in Hollywood.</p><p>"People with the most severe addiction problem will never understand just how absurdly powerful an addiction to fame and power is," a previous business associate of Scooter's said. "It's the single most wicked, evil, and disastrous addiction you can think of. You can do whatever you want, whenever you want. And that sort of power, once you have it, is the closest thing to impossible to give up."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZJ6ulafGsLrEZqOemaaeu6h50pymqKyVp3qjvsCupQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-is-everyone-leaving-scooter-braun.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-is-everyone-leaving-scooter-braun.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-is-everyone-leaving-scooter-braun.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-is-everyone-leaving-scooter-braun.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-is-everyone-leaving-scooter-braun.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-is-everyone-leaving-scooter-braun.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./insane-clown-posse.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./insane-clown-posse.html>Insane Clown Posse Neden Game lyr</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-plays-hector-in-fast-and-the-furious-and-why-is-he-known-as-the-famous-hector-actor.html>Who plays Hector in Fast and the Furious and why is he known as the famous Hector actor?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-plays-hector-in-fast-and-the-furious-and-why-is-he-known-as-the-famous-hector-actor.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
