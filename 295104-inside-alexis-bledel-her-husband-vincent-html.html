She played Pete Campbell, Kartheiser's character's mistress, for three seasons.</p><p class=dh>However, Kartheiser said they chose to remain professional while filming the hit show. Despite prioritizing their work over their relationship, Matthew Weiner, creator of "Mad Men," said he knew Bledel and Kartheiser were going to get married the first time they met.

Kartheiser felt it was essential to keep certain parts of his life private; he said if he shared the most important things with the world, it cheapened and weakened it.</p><p class=dh>Kartheiser's "Mad Men" co-star, Jon Hamm, said Kartheiser liked Bledel from the start and that he was a supporter of their relationship. In October 2012, Kartheiser and Bledel stepped out in public together and attended the Macallan Masters of Photography Series launch in New York City.</p><p class=dh>In 2013 they were each other's dates to the 19th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards at The Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. During a 2012 interview, Kartheiser said they prioritized seeing each other in person every ten days; facetime and texting could only go so far; he loved seeing her in person.</p><p class=dh>In March 2013, Kartheiser popped the question; a friend of the couple <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/alexis-bledel-vincent-kartheiser-engaged-mad-men-costars-to-marry-2013203/>said </a>they could not have been happier.

At the season six premiere of "Mad Men," he revealed that he would occasionally call Bledel his girlfriend and then remember they were engaged.</p><p class=dh>Bledel said they intended to plan their wedding together; at the time, they had not started the wedding planning process yet, but she was not shy to flaunt the round-cut diamond ring that she said Kartheiser picked out.</p><p class=dh>In October 2013, they attended Bledel's "Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" co-star Amber Tamblyn and David Cross's wedding. They spent Memorial day together enjoying the beaches in Hawaii and spent time together at the movies months before they got engaged.</p><p class=dh>In June 2014, they had an intimate wedding in Ojai, California.

Scott Patterson, who acted alongside Bledel in "Gilmore Girls," shared the information about their son when he revealed Bledel was a "proud mom." He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/vincent-kartheiser-alexis-bledel-welcome-son/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"She's blossomed as a woman, and now she's a proud new mother and married and happy."</p><p class=dh>Patterson <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.glamour.com/story/gilmore-girls-scott-patterson-on-luke-and-lorelai-relationship-in-netflix-revival>said </a>he was excited to reunite with Bledel for Netflix's "Gilmore Girls" revival and gushed about her being an "adorable human being." Patterson had a son who was not much older than Bledel's son, and the co-stars exchanged notes about parenthood.</p><p class=dh>He remembered when she was 18 years old, new to Hollywood, and overwhelmed. Patterson watched her grow into an adult, and they enjoyed each other's company, sharing videos, and he gave her parental tips about what to expect.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>What Is Known about Alexis Bledel and Vincent Kartheiser's Divorce?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Kartheiser was forty-three, and Bledel was forty when the "Mad Men" actor <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/alexis-bledels-husband-vincent-kartheiser-files-for-divorce/>filed for divorce</a> from Bledel.
