Hayes suggests that Ilja gains more by keeping them separated and implies that Ilja’s earlier comments were meant to create division between them and secure his control.</p><p>Ilja, maintaining his innocence, denies attacking Hayes and questions what Hayes is trying to create with these accusations.
