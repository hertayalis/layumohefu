The band was composed of Freddie Mercury (lead vocals and piano), Brian May (guitar and vocals), John Deacon (bass guitar), and Roger Taylor (drums and vocals). Freddie Mercury was known for his flamboyant stage presence and powerful vocals, while Brian May was recognized for his distinctive guitar playing style. John Deacon was the silent force behind the band's hit songs, providing solid basslines and innovative guitar work. Roger Taylor's powerful drumming and versatile vocal style rounded out the band's unique sound.<p>Queen released their self-titled debut album in 1973, which was followed by several critically acclaimed albums, including "Sheer Heart Attack" (1974), "A Night at the Opera" (1975), and "A Day at the Races" (1976). They achieved worldwide success with their hit songs, such as "Bohemian Rhapsody," "We Will Rock You," "We Are the Champions," "Somebody to Love," and "Don't Stop Me Now." The band's popularity skyrocketed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and they continued to release successful albums and tour the world until Freddie Mercury's untimely death in 1991.</p><p>Queen's influence on the rock music genre is undeniable, and they have been cited as one of the greatest bands of all time. They have sold over 150 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and their music continues to be popular and relevant to this day.</p><p>Queen is a legendary rock band that has left an indelible mark on the music world.

They perhaps may accept lower fees too. If you are seriously interested in booking Queen or other talent shown on our site, we will research their desire and the specific fee for your live-streaming event or project request.</p><p>Queen's current work schedule and location in relation to your event's type, date, budget, and locality will play a primary factor in the acceptance of booking Queen for your party. As long as your funding is commensurate with the price range to book Queen, CTI will propose your event to the official agency representing Queen. After we consult with them, we will provide a personal and accurate quote that includes: final costs, availability, and actual interest in being hired for your specific event or party.</p><p>CTI can give you the accurate Queen booking price once we submit your event details to their camp. "How much does it cost to book Queen for an event?" is a frequent question we get. The final Queen booking price is contingent on many variables and the booking fee we may show is based on a range derived from our past experience with what will Queen charge for an event. An example fee to book Queen is in the starting range of $2,000,000-$2,499,999. However, any recent popularity change would cause a price fluctuation well beyond this example. Also, their speaking fee might be different than the fee shown for the cost to perform or to just appear. Popularity, career stage, along with current demand will cause fluctuations in their speaking price as well. The final booking price may be more than what is shown, but you should at least have a budget within that range for them to consider an appearance, performance or speaking engagement.</p><p>There is low probability to book Queen for a party with anything substantially less than the published booking cost price range. We will negotiate with the Queen agent on your behalf if your funding is in place. By not having funding ready then it will more difficult to book Queen, because they get many offers to work events that are at or above asking price. It is also important to consider the travel costs when researching the Queen booking fee, as additional expenses like this, as well as an entourage of staff and equipment, are not necessarily built-in to the booking fee range shown. If your budget does not factor that in, then there is no benefit for them to want to be hired. We do not personally speak for Queen, but in our experience in booking talent for over 25 years, this is generally the outcome of inadequate funding.</p><p><b>Type</b><br>Performer</p><p><b>Style</b><br>Rock</p><p><b>Range</b><br>Rock, Rock-Classic, Rock-Hard, Male, Age Group-60's+, British</p><b>Bookmark and Share</b><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaK4xKerZ6aVqXy0rcypo56skaGyr8COa25waWFkvraxxKdm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jennifer-lawrence-cooke-maroney-matching-outfits-nyc-date-7782198.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jennifer-lawrence-cooke-maroney-matching-outfits-nyc-date-7782198.html>Jennifer Lawrence Matching With Her Husband During an NYC Day Date Will Make You Believe In Love</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./franco-columbu-wiki-biography-net-worth-age-career-relationship-family-html.html>Franco Columbu Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Age, Career, Relationship, Family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./franco-columbu-wiki-biography-net-worth-age-career-relationship-family-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
